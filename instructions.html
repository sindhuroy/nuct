<b><center>Here are some advisories for you guys</center></b><br>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">
1. NUCT will not interfere in team selection.But if any player who has objection with his team can dm admins, then only admins will interfere and will try to solve his issue.<br>
2. Admins will provide you with your match timings and if any team is not able to reach desired venue within half an hour of assigned time then that team will be disqualified and the opposition team will be declared winner.
And also if both teams are unable to come then both will be disqualified.<br>
3. Umpire's decision is final and non arguable and if any team argues with umpire then umpire holds the right to disqualify either the whole team or any of its player.<br>
4. Branches who have decided their final team and it's captain, captains can dm @Sourav Sharma(9311208369) for becoming part of captains whatsapp group and the branches who have not decided yet kindly do it before 22 april.<br>
Captain should not favour anybody so teams should chose their captains wisely.<br>
If captain is found to do favourism , he could also be disqualified.<br>
5. Information regarding ball will be conveyed to captain by admins. Captain will convey this to his team members.<br>
